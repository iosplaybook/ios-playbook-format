The iOS platform provides Secure Storage feature.

Secure Storage is a feature that protects application secrets stored on the device by encrypting them at rest.
### Demonstration
Set up demo app with the following configuration:

| Build variant | Debug |
Perform the following steps to enable Secure Storage:
