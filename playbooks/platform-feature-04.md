### Description

Install custom keyboard app

### Additional context

Custom Keyboard is a feature that allows users to install and use third-party keyboards from an app, select them for text input across supported apps, and grant additional access when Allow Full Access is enabled.

### Demonstration
#### 01. Prepare the environment

Set up the required environment with:
* A physical iPhone 15 running iOS 17.6
* A target app installed on the iPhone

#### 02. Install custom keyboard app

Download and install a keyboard app like `Gboard` on the iPhone. This provides the third-party keyboard for the test.

#### 03. Add custom keyboard to iPhone

Go to `Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard`, then tap \[Keyboard Name] under Third-Party Keyboards. This enables the keyboard for use in apps.
