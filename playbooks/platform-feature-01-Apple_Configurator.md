### Description

Retrieve an IPA

### Additional context

IPA acquisition is a feature that allows an IPA file to be obtained using Apple Configurator on macOS, enabling security testers to inspect the app's structure, configuration, permissions, and entitlements.

### Demonstration
#### 01. Prepare the environment

Set up the required environment with:
* A physical iPhone 15 running iOS 17.6
* A physical macOS workstation with Apple Configurator and Terminal
* A target app installed on the iPhone

#### 02. Provide access to app

Sign in to the same Apple ID on both the physical iOS device and the macOS workstation. This ensures Apple Configurator can access the app licenses and deploy apps associated with the Apple ID.

#### 03. Trigger IPA download

Connect the iPhone to the macOS workstation and open Apple Configurator. Select the connected device, open the Apps tab, click Add, and search for the target app. Adding the app causes Apple Configurator to download the current production package from Apple's servers and temporarily store it in the local cache.

#### 04. Save IPA

On the macOS workstation, open Terminal and navigate to the Apple Configurator temporary cache directory for the newly created .ipa file. Copy the file to your designated analysis workspace for static inspection and examination of its package structure.
