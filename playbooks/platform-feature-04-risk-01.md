### Description

Capture text input

### Goal

As a result, this could lead to **_Collection_** - attackers capturing sensitive information entered by the user.

### Demonstration
#### 01. Prepare the environment

Set up the required environment with:
* A physical iPhone 15 running iOS 17.6
* A physical macOS workstation with Xcode
* A target app installed on the iPhone

#### 02. Install custom keyboard app

Install the custom keyboard app on the iPhone. Use Xcode to open the [feature4-localkeyboard](https://github.com/zhiyi-school/iosplaybook_sideload/tree/main/localkeyboard) project, then build and run the app on the iPhone.

``` swift
// Record each keystroke entered by the user
KeystrokeStore.append(text)
```

#### 03. Add custom keyboard to iPhone

Go to `Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard`, then tap \[Keyboard Name] under Third-Party Keyboards. This enables the keyboard for use in apps.

#### 04. Give custom keyboard full access

In the Keyboards list, tap \[Keyboard Name], then enable Allow Full Access. This grants the permissions required for features such as custom themes and autocomplete.

#### 06. Check for captured text

Enter text into the target app using the custom keyboard, then return to the custom keyboard app to view the captured inputs. This verifies whether the custom keyboard can capture and retain text entered in the target app.
