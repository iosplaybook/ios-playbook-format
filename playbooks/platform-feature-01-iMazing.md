### Description

The iOS platform provides IPA acquisition feature.

### Additional context

IPA acquisition is a feature that allows an IPA file to be obtained using [iMazing](https://imazing.com/guides/how-to-manage-apps-without-itunes?utm_medium=app) on macOS, enabling security testers to inspect the app's structure, configuration, permissions, and entitlements.

### Demonstration

Set up a physical iOS device with the following configuration:

| Configuration | Detail         |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Device model  | iPhone 15      |
| iOS Version   | 17.6           |
| Device State  | Non-Jailbroken |
| App Used      | HealthHub      |

Perform the following steps to enable IPA acquisition:

1. Install and start iMazing. This gives you access to the tools required to manage apps on the connected iPhone and export IPA files.
2. Select `Devices`, and then select the connected iPhone. This displays the apps and management options for the selected device.

4. Install the app that you intend to export. This ensures that iMazing can access the app package required for export. Note: wait for the installation to complete before you continue.
