### Description

Obfuscate plaintext literals

### Demonstration
#### 01. Set up plaintext literals obfuscation

Set up the Swift Confidential build plugin in Xcode. This allows the plugin to access the app's source code and replace plaintext literals with obfuscated code during the build.

#### 02. Specify plaintext literals for obfuscation

Move plaintext literals to `confidential.yml`. This allows the plugin to generate obfuscated Swift accessors for those literals during the build. Note: The `confidential.yml` file should not be built into the app bundle.

#### 03. Replace plaintext literals with references

Replace plaintext literals with the generated Swift accessors. This ensures that the app references the obfuscated accessors instead of the original plaintext literals.

#### 04. Verify plaintext literals are obfuscated

Rebuild the app and use a static analysis tool, such as MobSF, to verify that the original plaintext literals are no longer easily recoverable from the `.ipa` file. Note: Swift Confidential prevents easy static extraction but not runtime attacks such as hooking, memory dumping, or patching.
